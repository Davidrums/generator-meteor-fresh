Boilerplate Generator Template
========================================

A simple Yeoman generator using Git submodules to clone over a boilerplate hosted elsewhere on GitHub.

Getting started
---------------

These are a few things you will want to customize:

1. README.md: Anywhere you see -boilerplate should be customized with the name of the generator you are creating (e.g generator-bill)
2. package.json: Customize the repository, author and dependencies.
3. .gitmodules: Customize the submodule(s) you would like pulled down and copied when a new project is being created.

Usage
---------------

1. Install Yeoman: `npm install -g yo`
2. Install the generator locally: `npm install -g generator-boilerplate`
3. Run: `yo generator-boilerplate`
4. Start using Boilerplate
